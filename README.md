# LinkedListC
pass it a file in the following format:
123 fred
1   bob
23  jim
223  rick
35  stan
54  chuck
43  bill
34  james
69  jake
#note that spaces are not allowed, and it will compile just ignore everything after the space.
this is not meant to be an effecient way to list a file but rather an implementation of a linked list which I wanted to share
(arrays are superior)
